You are given an integer array.

The array is considered valid if it is non-decreasing.
(nums[i] <= nums[i+1] for all i)

You are allowed to perform the following operation:
➤ Pick any adjacent pair and merge them into one element
  with value = sum of the pair.

Your task is to find the minimum number of such operations
required to make the array non-decreasing.
